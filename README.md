# Some Stupid Game Name 

You find yourself in a basement of some rural apartment, being either nice little cat or giant fat disgusting rat. 


Your world has two space and one time dimensions. All the dimensions are discrete, and it's impossible to move more than one unit in any space direction at a moment of time. The other fact the God thinks is good to know for you is that your speed is of course equal to the speed of light. 


Unfortunately the universe was just created, so at first you may feel yourself a little bit blind. Don't give up, nothing to see anyway. 


To make the game more friendly, the world is seen from above. When your character moves, you can make a move. The God was really sorry to break our anticipations, but currently the walls are thick and tunneling has probability zero.  


Don't forget, that if you are a mouse, you can be caught by a cat :( Yet it's hard for me to imagine how stupid you should be to let it happen. 


Don't forget, that being a cat implies you are Schrodingers pet, so if anyone sees you first time, you die with probability 50%. 


Of course, the goal is to get out of the basement alive as fast as possible.
